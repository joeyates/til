# Carbonara

This recipe uses eggs and does not fully cook them.
It should only be used with eggs that you trust do not
have salmonella or other problematic bacteria.

This recipe does *not* contain cream. I believe the addition
of cream is a mistake, made in the belief that the creaminess
of Carbonara requires it - it does not.

## Ingredients

For 2 people

* 1 small pack of lardons
* 1 egg
* 200g thick spaghetti
* one medium onion (yellowish or whitish, not red)
* 50g finely grated Parmesan cheese,
* coursely ground pepper
* salt

## Preparation

* Boil a large pan of water. Salt with about 1tsp of salt.
* Put the lardons in a frying pan on minimum. They should release
  their fat.
* In the meantime, slice the onion into slivers as finely as
  possible. Do not dice,
* Add the the onions to the frying pan and cook *as slowly as possible*,
* If the fat from the lardons is not sufficient, and the pan seems dry,
  add a little olive oil,
* Cook the pasta for the recommended time,
* Just before the pasta finishes cooking, save a cupful of its
  water,
* Strain the pasta,
* Turn of the heat to the frying pan,
* Add the pasta,
* Add a little of the saved pasta water,
* Break the egg over the pasta and stir,
* Add the Parmesan and, if necessary, some more water in order
  to obtain a creamy sauce,
