# Name

PWM = Pulse-Wave Modulation

# Application

Used to produce an analog signal from a binary input.
E.g. for the control of electrical motors.
Supplied voltage is either 1 or 0.
The voltage is supplied for brief periods.
Motor controlled by average voltage by varying the duration of the supply.
The regular period needs to be much higher than the desired frequency.

# Terminology

* period - the interval between pulses,
* duty cycle - percentage of period for which the voltage is supplied.
